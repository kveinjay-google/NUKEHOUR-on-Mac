# Engine patches

The `engine/` directory is a pristine, gitignored checkout of
`OpenRA/OpenRA @ release-20250330` (see `mod.config`). Every local engine
modification MUST be captured here as a patch, otherwise it is lost the next
time `fetch-engine.sh` re-downloads the engine.

Patches apply in filename order with `patch -p1` from the engine root.
`fetch-engine.sh` applies them automatically after every fresh download via
`apply-engine-patches.sh`.

## Series

| Patch | Files | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0001-launchinto-ordermanager-race.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Game.cs` | Fix null-World race when `LoadComplete` synchronously replaces `Game.OrderManager` during `Game.LaunchInto` (skirmish deep-link from the main menu). |
| `0002-launchinto-deeplinks.patch` | `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/MainMenuLogic.cs` | Launcher deep-links: `LaunchInto "<command> <arg>"` supports `replay`, `loadsave`, `skirmish <map> <lobby-cmds>`, `connect <host>:<port>`, plus panel shortcuts (`settings`, `replays`, `missions`, `editor`, `music`, `content`, ...). Hoists `world`/`contentInstaller` fields and extracts `OpenSettingsPanel`. |
| `0003-engine-i18n-language-selection.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/FluentProvider.cs`, `OpenRA.Game/Settings.cs`, `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Settings/DisplaySettingsLogic.cs`, `mods/common/chrome/settings-display.yaml`, `mods/common/fluent/chrome.ftl` | User-selectable UI language: `Game.Settings.Game.Language` (default `en`), loaded as `fluent/<lang>/` overrides of each `FluentMessages` entry with English fallback, plus a language dropdown in Display settings (restart required). |
| `0004-engine-common-zh-cn-translations.patch` | `mods/common/fluent/zh-CN/*.ftl` (new) | Simplified Chinese translations for engine-common strings (chrome/common/hotkeys/rules). |
| `0005-power-counter-respect-textcolor.patch` | `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Ingame/IngamePowerCounterLogic.cs` | Preserve each mod's configured normal power-counter color while retaining the critical red state. |
| `0006-settings-tab-fluent-labels.patch` | `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Settings/SettingsLogic.cs` | Resolve settings tab labels and reset-dialog panel names through Fluent. |
| `0007-language-restart-and-system-default.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Settings.cs`, `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Settings/DisplaySettingsLogic.cs` | Select Chinese from the system UI culture, expose language changes in restart-required state, and reset language with other game settings. |
| `0008-integrated-ios-runtime.patch` | Engine runtime, common chrome/localization, and regression tests | Replays the completed iOS touch, safe-area, multiplayer, diagnostics/performance, audio/haptics, gameplay, V3/Kirov audit, and responsive HUD integration captured by this repository. |
| `0009-ios-two-finger-gesture-arbitration.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Input/TouchGestureAdapter.cs`, `OpenRA.Platforms.Default/Sdl2Input.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/TouchGestureAdapterTest.cs` | Adds immediate, mode-locked two-finger pan/pinch arbitration while preserving short two-finger right-click and three-finger pan compatibility. |
| `0010-audio-bag-wav-safety.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Sound/Sound.cs`, `OpenRA.Mods.Common/FileFormats/WavReader.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/WavReaderSafetyTest.cs` | Rejects malformed WAV streams before deferred reads, tolerates unknown/truncated chunks, and isolates corrupt sound effects so one asset cannot terminate the game loop. |
| `0011-order-feedback-effects.patch` | `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Traits/World/OrderEffects.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/OrderFeedbackEffectsTest.cs` | Adds optional order-aware one-shot sprite feedback while preserving the existing target flash fallback for unconfigured and unmapped orders. |
| `0012-ios-lobby-responsive-layout.patch` | iOS lobby/map-preview/multiplayer layout policies, runtime wiring, and regression tests | Reflows nested map states, localized status/action text, lobby surfaces, server details, client rows, and footer controls across supported iPhone and iPad landscape sizes. |
| `0013-post-0012-overlay-sync.patch` | Four iOS viewport source/test files plus `V3RenderingRulesTest.cs` and `YuriProductionCameoTest.cs` | Synchronizes already-committed engine overlay drift after 0012 without adding the A1 quarter-ring behavior. |
| `0014-ios-three-action-quarter-ring.patch` | iOS viewport geometry/actions/joystick sources and three regression suites | Implements the approved A1 three-action quarter ring, circular initial joystick hit area, and touch command-bar/base-cycle coverage. |
| `0015-ios-lobby-scroll-layout-polish.patch` | Five iOS lobby/map-preview/scroll policies and two regression suites | Replays the disjoint lobby, map-preview, chat, and scroll-arrow layout polish that remains outside A1; the root mod `chrome.yaml` stays in the outer repository. |
| `0016-ios-lobby-direct-start-progress-faction-picker.patch` | Multiplayer readiness protocol, iOS lobby UI, common chrome/localization, and regression tests | Starts iOS-hosted games with one tap only after every connected human has the current map ready, shows truthful download/verification blockers and progress, and enlarges the iOS faction selector without changing the desktop lobby UI. |
| `0017-ios-safe-start-rejection-correlation.patch` | 12 engine networking, server, lobby, and regression-test paths | Advances to Orders23 with correlated safe-start requests and rejections, prevents a stale response from clearing a newer pending request, and shows the authoritative blocker or progress immediately. It changes no Fluent/YAML, desktop behavior, or safe-start safety semantics. |
| `0018-nuke-hour-brand-language.patch` | 10 engine language, menu/settings, and regression-test paths | Adds the persistent `System` / `zh-CN` / `en` language policy, quick main-menu selector, simplified game-settings title, and NUKE HOUR branding assertions. Root mod, iOS, launcher, artwork, and packaging changes remain outside this engine patch. |
| `0019-ios-support-powers-beside-production.patch` | `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Ingame/IosSupportPowerLayoutPolicy.cs`, `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Ingame/SupportPowerBinLogic.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/IosSupportPowerLayoutPolicyTest.cs` | Places compact iPhone support powers immediately beside the full visible production sidebar, fills columns bottom-to-top and leftward, and adds layout and visible-widget-tree regression coverage. |
| `0020-macos-nuke-hour-runtime-branding.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Game.cs`, `OpenRA.Game/Settings.cs`, `OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/MainMenuLogic.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/IosMenuLayoutPolicyTest.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/NukeHourBrandingTest.cs` | Aligns the default player identity and local skirmish title with NUKE HOUR, adds the macOS-only About flow, and covers desktop/iOS menu isolation with regression tests. |
| `0021-independent-product-and-compatibility-versions.patch` | Engine manifest, networking, diagnostics, version-label logic, and regression tests | Separates the user-visible product release from stable storage and deterministic multiplayer compatibility while preserving the existing handshake wire field. |
| `0022-macos-content-source-delivery.patch` | 9 installer/content-source engine and regression-test paths | Captures the already-committed bounded macOS retail-content discovery overlay so a fresh engine checkout reproduces the shipping content importer exactly. |
| `0023-nukehour-multiplayer-protocol.patch` | 11 shared handshake, compatibility, lobby, localization, and regression-test paths | Adds the symmetric NUKE HOUR handshake schema, canonical runtime profile/contract, stable rejection reasons, and real TCP-framing interoperability tests. |
| `0024-runtime-contract-resource-compatibility.patch` | 3 RuntimeContract and regression-test paths | Replaces whole-retail-archive identity with required presentation-capability validation, advances the capability id, and adds RC1-RC9 false-rejection and safety coverage. |
| `0025-phase12-cross-platform-physical-smoke.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Support/IosMultiplayerSmoke.cs`, `OpenRA.Game/Sync.cs`, `OpenRA.Test/IosMultiplayerPolicyTest.cs` | Makes the opt-in physical smoke use the active cross-platform RuntimeContract, requires observable gameplay and sustained-sync evidence, and unifies desktop/iOS boolean sync hashing after physical-device desync diagnosis. |
| `0026-nukehour-dedicated-server-foundation.patch` | 10 engine runtime, server, physical-smoke, and regression-test paths | Adds explicit dedicated-server identity, a presentation-only headless RuntimeContract path, numeric listen-address/dynamic-port settings, bounded capacity and idle handling, one-process/one-room lifecycle, atomic health status, and signal-safe clean exit without changing the shared Phase 1 protocol. |
| `0027-post-phase2-engine-sync.patch` | 4 iOS sidebar/startup-notice engine and regression-test paths | Captures the already-committed full-height iOS production-sidebar correction and startup distribution-notice test so a fresh checkout matches the current product baseline before Phase 3. |
| `0028-online-lobby-room-directory.patch` | 21 shared directory, dedicated-server registration, multiplayer-browser, physical-smoke, responsive layout, localization, and regression-test paths | Adds authenticated official-room registration, short-lived metadata discovery, Local/Online client modes, room-list and room-code lookup, HTTPS-only directory access, preflight compatibility checks, hidden Online endpoints, and direct gameplay handoff without changing the shared game protocol. |
| `0029-ios-ingame-sidebar-quickbar.patch` | 5 iOS production-sidebar layout/runtime and command-bar regression-test paths | Sizes the final production-sidebar fill row to the exact remaining height so it cannot overlap the bottom cap, and records the larger, label-aware, frameless touch-command icon layout used by the outer RA2 widget implementation. |
| `0031-macos-content-manager-return.patch` | `OpenRA.Game/Game.cs`, content availability/manager logic, and `OpenRA.Test/Ra2ContentInstallerManifestTest.cs` | Gives launcher-owned clean-build content management an explicit cancel contract: Back exits the game child and restores the still-running macOS launcher, while successful content validation clears the one-shot policy so later in-game content management still returns to the game menu. |
| `0032-ios-sidebar-scroll-button-slot.patch` | iOS production-sidebar layout/runtime and `IosProductionBatchToggleTest.cs` | Anchors both production scroll buttons to the authored slot at the top of the full-height sidebar bottom cap, applying the nested production-type offset exactly once so the artwork and hit targets cannot fall below the cap. |

## Regenerating after editing engine sources

A target patch must be diffed against the official release **after** replaying
every patch that sorts before it. In other words, `a/` comes from the
post-predecessor `BASE`, not directly from the pristine archive.

# The verifier creates a second fresh extraction, replays exactly 0001-0023,

```

Before accepting a new patch, use a second fresh extraction, capture the full
verbose output, and apply every predecessor with the verbose replay command
shown above. Any nonzero exit, unexpected `offset`/`fuzz` diagnostic, or
`.rej`/`.orig` file fails the gate. The only historical exception is the exact
two-diagnostic `0007` result pinned above; new patches do not inherit it.
For `0024`, verify exactly three unique, paired `diff -ruN a/... b/...` sections.
The verifier consumes each section's headers and every unified hunk through its
declared old/new line counts; it rejects preambles, indentation, alternate
prefixes, binary/index/rename metadata, or any other trailing content.
Root files, iOS, launcher, artwork, docs, packaging, `mods/ra2`, application
bundles, `obj`, and `bin` paths are outside the engine delivery boundary. The
portable verifier performs the equivalent strict gates:

```sh
(cd "$BASE" && git apply --check --verbose -p1 -- "$CANDIDATE")
/usr/bin/patch --forward --verbose -p1 --batch -F 0 -V none \
	-d "$BASE" -i "$CANDIDATE"
```

`-F 0` disables fuzz but does not disable offsets, so the captured strict log
must independently contain no offset/fuzz diagnostics. All three allowlisted
results must compare byte-for-byte with `engine/`, and every path in the union
of `git ls-files -z -- engine` and the allowlist must be present and identical.
A failed forward dry-run must leave the Python byte-sorted full-tree SHA-256
manifest unchanged; a reverse dry-run must succeed and also leave it unchanged.
Any `.rej`, `.orig`, symlink, missing path, or outside-allowlist drift fails the
delivery. The verifier writes per-command logs, the full manifest, and atomic
`evidence.json` under its unique output directory.

The integrated series was last regenerated from the official
`OpenRA-release-20250330` archive with SHA-256
`ef593816d1a15443c82e865dfd1efa48e9c82e249245b208ce80e6a2900d9d0a`.

Engine upgrades: bump `ENGINE_VERSION` in `mod.config`, delete `engine/`,
run `./fetch-engine.sh`, and rebase every patch that fails to apply.
